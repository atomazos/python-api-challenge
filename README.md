# python-api-challenge

I coded a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ randomly selected cities across the globe with varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, a simple Python library was employed, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities. Using the matplotlib library, I created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

 - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
 - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
 - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
 - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
